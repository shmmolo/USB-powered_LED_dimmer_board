# USB-powered_LED_dimmer_board
Compact USB-powered LED dimmer that uses a 555 timer (NE555P) in astable mode to generate PWM signal. The PWM signal controls the brightness of an LED strip via an NMOS transistor. Designed for educational and prototyping purposes, it demonstrates power protection, ESD safety, and efficient PWM control in a double-sided PCB.
